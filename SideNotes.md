Payments & Monetization on Nummutex
When you publish your game or app on Nummutex, users handle payments directly through our secure site. We support multiple easy methods like UPI, PayPal, credit/debit cards, and more – all end-to-end managed for smooth transactions globally.
We take a small, fair cut (standard platform fee) to cover hosting, updates, AXC protection, voice chat infrastructure, and ongoing maintenance. This way, you focus on building great games while we handle the security, distribution, and payments hassle-free.
No extra setup needed on your end – just set your price (or go free), and earnings get paid out regularly.
This keeps things simple for devs and safe for players.
